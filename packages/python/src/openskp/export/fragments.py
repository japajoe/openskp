"""ThatOpen Fragments (``.frag``) export AND import - EXPERIMENTAL.

Converts an :class:`openskp.instanced_scene.InstancedScene` directly to
and from ThatOpen's own FlatBuffers-based ``.frag`` binary format
(https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment), the format their
``@thatopen/fragments``/``@thatopen/components`` viewer stack actually
loads and streams. Fragments is NOT IFC-specific - it is a generic,
publicly documented, instancing-native geometry+BIM format (deduplicated
"Shell" geometry referenced by many "Sample" placements) that ThatOpen's
own documentation explicitly invites third-party importers/exporters to
target directly. See ``openskp/_fragments_fb/index.fbs`` for the vendored
schema this module reads and writes against.

:func:`to_fragments`/:func:`export` (writing) came first; :func:`from_fragments`/
:func:`read` (reading, below the writing side in this file) came later, once
export was proven against the real runtime. Reading turns ``.frag`` into
OpenSKP's own 6th input format alongside ``.skp``: any file - one this
module wrote, one ThatOpen's real ``IfcImporter`` produced from an IFC
file, or anyone else's - becomes an :class:`InstancedScene` that rides
every OTHER export this project already has (GLB, OBJ, STL, PLY, DXF,
IFC4, JSON, and ``.skp`` itself via the writer) for free, the same
relationship every other reader here has to its own format.

Why this exists: the common integration path today is
``.skp -> IFC (text) -> web-ifc WASM -> .frag`` purely to get a SketchUp
model into a ThatOpen-based viewer. That round-trip through IFC's verbose
ASCII STEP text format is measured to cost tens of seconds on real files
for a step that is otherwise pure geometry repackaging. Going directly
from OpenSKP's own already-triangulated, already-deduplicated
:class:`InstancedScene` to Fragments' binary schema skips that entirely.

**Status - read before relying on this in production:**

- Confirmed working end-to-end against the REAL, unmodified
  ``@thatopen/fragments`` library: output loads, triangulates, and
  renders correctly, including genuine instance deduplication (one
  shared ``Shell`` referenced by many placements) and rotation.
- Non-uniform scale and mirrored (negative-determinant) instance
  transforms are SUPPORTED, not just tolerated: Fragments' ``Transform``
  struct has no scale field at all (confirmed by reading the real
  importer's own serialization code), so this module bakes each
  instance's scale/mirror into its OWN geometry variant before writing -
  see :func:`_decompose_trs` and :func:`_bake_primitive`. Instances that
  share the exact same (definition, scale) combination still dedupe
  against each other and share one baked ``Shell``, mirroring the real
  importer's own scale-hash caching behavior; only genuinely distinct
  scale factors get their own copy.
- The exported spatial structure reproduces the source scene's REAL
  component nesting (groups containing groups containing geometry,
  matching SketchUp's own outliner), not a flat list - see
  :func:`to_fragments`'s internal ``build_spatial_node`` recursion. A
  node gets a ``local_id`` only if it's one of the tracked
  geometry-bearing items; a pure organizational container just wraps its
  children. Confirmed against the real loader's own
  ``getSpatialStructure()`` on a real component-within-a-component
  ``.skp`` file.
- Definitions with more than 65,535 points per shell correctly switch to
  the wide (``BigShell``) index encoding; this is mechanical and has not
  been exercised against a real definition that large yet.

**Reading status:**

- Round-trips this module's own output exactly: world-space vertex
  positions across a real ``.skp``-derived scene match to the last bit
  (verified in ``tests/test_fragments.py``'s ``TestFromFragments``), not
  just object/vertex counts.
- Reads real, third-party ``.frag`` files too, not just its own encoder's
  output: a real ThatOpen-produced production file (a genuine IFC-derived
  building, not a synthetic fixture) reads cleanly, and re-exporting it
  through this same module and loading THAT back through the actual
  ``@thatopen/fragments`` runtime preserves real IFC GUIDs and category
  names - see this module's own dev history for the full verification, or
  ``tests/fixtures/thatopen_small_test.frag`` (MIT-licensed, from
  ThatOpen's own ``resources/frags/``) for the smaller committed fixture.
- What the format genuinely cannot give back, stated honestly rather than
  glossed over: no UVs anywhere in the schema (every reconstructed
  primitive gets an all-zero UV band), no stored vertex normals (rebuilt
  as flat per-face normals, correct for a hard-edged shell but not the
  original smooth-shading groups), and a purely organizational (non-
  geometry) node's own local transform was never serialized - only
  geometry-bearing items' full WORLD transforms survive. See
  :func:`from_fragments`'s own docstring for the complete list, including
  ``RepresentationClass.CIRCLE_EXTRUSION`` (round profiles), which isn't
  read yet - skipped with a warning, not silently misread as a shell.

See ``docs/IFC_PIPELINE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`` for the broader context
this was built to address, and ``CHECKLIST.md`` for this feature's
running status.

# other reader in this project has to its own format, just with ``.frag``
# as the 6th input format instead of ``.skp``.
#
# What the format genuinely cannot tell us back, stated honestly:
#
# - No UVs anywhere in the schema (``Shell`` is points + triangle indices
#   only) - every reconstructed primitive gets an all-zero UV band.
#   Materials are flat RGBA (``Material.R/G/B/A``); there is nothing
#   resembling a texture reference to read either.
# - No stored vertex normals - only points/triangles. Reconstructed here as
#   one flat per-face normal, duplicated across that face's 3 vertices;
#   correct for a hard-edged BREP-style shell, but any original smooth-
#   shading group is gone (Fragments never had anywhere to keep it).
# - A wrapper (organizational, non-geometry) ``SpatialStructure`` node's own
#   local transform was never serialized - only geometry-bearing items'
#   WORLD transforms survive, via ``Meshes.GlobalTransforms``. Reconstructed
#   wrapper nodes get an identity matrix; since every geometry leaf's own
#   matrix is set to its full world transform directly (not composed
#   through its ancestors), an identity-matrix ancestor chain still
#   composes to the exactly correct world placement - it just can't
#   recover what the ORIGINAL per-level split looked like before export.
# - ``RepresentationClass.CIRCLE_EXTRUSION`` (round profiles - rebar, pipes)
#   has no reader here yet, only ``SHELL``. A real IfcImporter-produced
#   file can contain these; such samples are skipped with a warning rather
#   than silently dropped or misread as shells - see
