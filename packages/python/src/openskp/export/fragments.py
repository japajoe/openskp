"""ThatOpen Fragments (``.frag``) export - EXPERIMENTAL.

Converts an :class:`openskp.instanced_scene.InstancedScene` directly into
ThatOpen's own FlatBuffers-based ``.frag`` binary format
(https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment), the format their
``@thatopen/fragments``/``@thatopen/components`` viewer stack actually
loads and streams. Fragments is NOT IFC-specific - it is a generic,
publicly documented, instancing-native geometry+BIM format (deduplicated
"Shell" geometry referenced by many "Sample" placements) that ThatOpen's
own documentation explicitly invites third-party importers/exporters to
target directly. See ``openskp/_fragments_fb/index.fbs`` for the vendored
schema this module writes against.

Why this exists: the common integration path today is
``.skp -> IFC (text) -> web-ifc WASM -> .frag`` purely to get a SketchUp
model into a ThatOpen-based viewer. That round-trip through IFC's verbose
ASCII STEP text format is measured to cost tens of seconds on real files
for a step that is otherwise pure geometry repackaging. Going directly
from OpenSKP's own already-triangulated, already-deduplicated
:class:`InstancedScene` to Fragments' binary schema skips that entirely.

**Status - read before relying on this in production:**

- Confirmed working end-to-end against the REAL, unmodified
  ``@thatopen/fragments`` library: output loads, triangulates, and
  renders correctly, including genuine instance deduplication (one
  shared ``Shell`` referenced by many placements) and rotation.
- Non-uniform scale and mirrored (negative-determinant) instance
  transforms are SUPPORTED, not just tolerated: Fragments' ``Transform``
  struct has no scale field at all (confirmed by reading the real
  importer's own serialization code), so this module bakes each
  instance's scale/mirror into its OWN geometry variant before writing -
  see :func:`_decompose_trs` and :func:`_bake_primitive`. Instances that
  share the exact same (definition, scale) combination still dedupe
  against each other and share one baked ``Shell``, mirroring the real
  importer's own scale-hash caching behavior; only genuinely distinct
  scale factors get their own copy.
- The exported spatial structure reproduces the source scene's REAL
  component nesting (groups containing groups containing geometry,
  matching SketchUp's own outliner), not a flat list - see
  :func:`to_fragments`'s internal ``build_spatial_node`` recursion. A
  node gets a ``local_id`` only if it's one of the tracked
  geometry-bearing items; a pure organizational container just wraps its
  children. Confirmed against the real loader's own
  ``getSpatialStructure()`` on a real component-within-a-component
  ``.skp`` file.
- Definitions with more than 65,535 points per shell correctly switch to
  the wide (``BigShell``) index encoding; this is mechanical and has not
  been exercised against a real definition that large yet.

See ``docs/IFC_PIPELINE_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`` for the broader context
this was built to address, and ``CHECKLIST.md`` for this feature's
running status.
