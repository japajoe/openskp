## What is OpenSKP?

OpenSKP is the first and only open-source, cross-platform parser for SketchUp
binary files — reverse-engineered from both the modern **VFF container**
(SketchUp 2021+) and the classic **MFC `CArchive`** container (SketchUp
2013–2020). It gives you full programmatic access to geometry, materials,
components, layers, and metadata, with no SketchUp installation and no
proprietary SDK required. The same parser and export API also ship as
first-class packages for TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++ — see the
[project README](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp) for the full
cross-language picture.

## Features

- **Full-fidelity parsing** — vertices, edges, faces, normals, UV
  coordinates, nested component hierarchies, layers/tags, materials,
  textures, styles, and dynamic-component attributes.
- **Both SketchUp file generations** — modern VFF (2021+) and legacy MFC
  (2013–2020) containers, transparently, behind one `parse()` call.
- **Scene baking** — an opt-in `build_scene()` pass resolves the full placed
  scene graph to world-space, triangulated, export-ready geometry.
- **Native multi-format export** — glTF (GLB), Wavefront OBJ/MTL, STL,
  PLY, AutoCAD DXF (3DFACE and Polyface Mesh), IFC4 (BIM/ISO 10303-21 STEP),
  and JSON — all written from scratch, no third-party CAD/BIM SDK involved.
  The DXF writer is verified against real desktop AutoCAD, not just lenient
  DXF readers.
- **Streaming / low-memory parsing** — peak memory is bounded by the
  largest single definition, not the whole file.
- **Structured observability** — opt-in progress reporting and
  location-carrying parse errors for debugging malformed or unusual files.

## Installation

```bash
pip install openskp
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp.git
cd openskp/packages/python
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from openskp import SkpFile

# Parse an SKP file
skp = SkpFile.open("model.skp")
model = skp.parse()

# Inspect layers
for layer in model.layers:
    print(f"{layer.name}: rgb({layer.color_r}, {layer.color_g}, {layer.color_b})")

# Inspect definitions (component geometry)
for defn in model.definitions.values():
    print(f"{defn.name}: {len(defn.faces)} faces, {len(defn.vertices)} vertices")

# Inspect resolved, world-space scene hierarchy (opt-in, heavier)
scene = skp.build_scene()
for inst in scene.scene_hierarchy.children:
    print(f"  {inst.name} [{inst.layer}] @ {inst.position_mm}")
```

## Exporting

```python
from openskp.export import glb, obj, stl, ply, dxf, ifc, json_export

# Export to GLB (glTF 2.0 binary) - takes the SkpFile itself
glb.export(skp, "output.glb")

# Export to Wavefront OBJ (+ companion .mtl) - takes a built Scene
obj.export(scene, "output.obj")

# Export to STL (3D Printing ASCII/Binary)
stl.export(scene, "output.stl", binary=True)

# Export to PLY (Stanford 3D Triangle Mesh)
ply.export(scene, "output.ply", binary=True)

# Export to AutoCAD 3D DXF (AutoCAD R2000 compliant, Polyface Mesh by default)
dxf.export(scene, "output.dxf")

# Export to IFC4 / BIM (ISO 10303-21 STEP ASCII format)
ifc.export(scene, "output.ifc")

# Export metadata as JSON - pass scene= to include the resolved hierarchy
meta = json_export.to_dict(model, scene=scene)
json_export.export(model, "output.json", scene=scene)
```

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.9
- NumPy ≥ 1.20
- Trimesh ≥ 3.0
- Shapely ≥ 1.8

## Used in Production

OpenSKP powers the SketchUp import pipeline for
[FrameSmart](https://frame-smart.com/) (a 3D collaboration platform with
nearly 200 active users) and [IngeTrazo](https://ingetrazo.com/) (a
SketchUp-alternative 3D modeler with a BIM → IFC bridge). Using OpenSKP in
