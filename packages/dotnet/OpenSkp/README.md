# OpenSKP

**The open-source SketchUp (`.skp`) file parser — C# / .NET edition.**

Parse `.skp` files without SketchUp. No SDK. No license. Just code.

## 🌟 What is OpenSKP?

OpenSKP is the first and only open-source, cross-platform parser for
SketchUp binary files — reverse-engineered from both the modern **VFF
container** (SketchUp 2021+) and the classic **MFC `CArchive`** container
(SketchUp 2013–2020). It gives .NET developers (desktop, cloud, and
mobile) full programmatic access to geometry, materials, components,
layers, and metadata, with no SketchUp installation and no proprietary SDK
required. The same parser and export API also ship as first-class packages
for Python, TypeScript, Dart, and C++ — see the
[project README](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp) for the full
cross-language picture.

## ✨ Features

- **Full-fidelity parsing** — vertices, edges, faces, normals, UV
  coordinates, nested component hierarchies, layers/tags, materials,
  textures, styles, and dynamic-component attributes.
- **Both SketchUp file generations** — modern VFF (2021+) and legacy MFC
  (2013–2020) containers, transparently, behind one `SkpFile.Open()` call.
- **Scene baking** — an opt-in `SkpFile.BuildScene()` pass resolves the
  full placed scene graph to world-space, triangulated, export-ready
  geometry.
- **Native multi-format export** — glTF (GLB), Wavefront OBJ/MTL, STL,
  PLY, AutoCAD DXF (3DFACE and Polyface Mesh), IFC4 (BIM/ISO 10303-21
  STEP), and JSON — all written from scratch, no third-party CAD/BIM SDK
  involved. The DXF writer is verified against real desktop AutoCAD, not
  just lenient DXF readers.
- **No practical file-size ceiling** — unlike the CLR's ~2.1 GB array/
  `MemoryStream` cap, OpenSKP's `ChunkedBuffer` and 64-bit TLV offsets
  remove that limit entirely: verified against a real 620 MB `.skp` file
  (153,586 definitions) with zero special configuration.
- **Structured observability** — opt-in progress reporting and
  location-carrying parse errors for debugging malformed or unusual files.

## 🚀 Installation

Install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package OpenSkp
```

Or via the NuGet Package Manager:

```powershell
Install-Package OpenSkp
```

## 💻 Quick Start

### 1. Parse an SKP File
Open and parse a SketchUp model to inspect its metadata:

```csharp
using System;
using OpenSkp;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Open and decode an SKP file
        SkpModel model = SkpFile.Open("house.skp");

        Console.WriteLine($"SketchUp File Version: {model.Version}");
        
        // Print Layer Names
        Console.WriteLine("Layers:");
        foreach (var layer in model.Layers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {layer.Name} (RGB: {layer.ColorR}, {layer.ColorG}, {layer.ColorB})");
        }

        // Print Materials List
        Console.WriteLine("Materials:");
        foreach (var material in model.Materials)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"- {material.Name} (Transparency: {material.Transparency})");
        }

        // Walk component definitions and their geometry
        foreach (var kvp in model.Definitions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Definition {kvp.Key}: {kvp.Value.Name} - {kvp.Value.Vertices.Count} vertices, {kvp.Value.Faces.Count} faces");
        }

        // model.Root holds whatever is placed directly in the model (not
        // inside any component/group), including root-level instances.
        Console.WriteLine($"Root-level instances: {model.Root.Instances.Count}");

        // Build scene graph into world-space meshes and export to DXF / IFC / GLB / OBJ / STL / PLY
        Scene scene = SkpFile.BuildScene("house.skp");
        DxfExport.ExportDxf(scene, "house.dxf");
        IfcExport.ExportIfc(scene, "house.ifc");
        GlbExport.ExportGlb(scene, "house.glb");
        ObjExport.ExportObj(scene, "house.obj");
        StlExport.ExportStl(scene, "house.stl");
        PlyExport.ExportPly(scene, "house.ply");
    }
}
```

## ⚙️ Target Frameworks

OpenSKP targets **.NET Standard 2.0**, ensuring full compatibility with:
- **.NET 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9** (Console, Web APIs, ASP.NET Core)
- **.NET Core 2.0+**
- **.NET Framework 4.6.1+** (WPF, WinForms)
- **Mono / Xamarin / .NET MAUI** (iOS, Android)

## 🏭 Used in Production

OpenSKP powers the SketchUp import pipeline for
[FrameSmart](https://frame-smart.com/) (a 3D collaboration platform with
nearly 200 active users) and [IngeTrazo](https://ingetrazo.com/) (a
SketchUp-alternative 3D modeler with a BIM → IFC bridge). Using OpenSKP in
your own project? [Open an issue](https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp/issues)
or a PR to get added here.
