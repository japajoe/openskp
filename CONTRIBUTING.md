# Contributing to OpenSKP

First off — **thank you** for considering contributing to OpenSKP! 🎉

This project exists because someone decided a proprietary file format shouldn't be locked behind a proprietary SDK. Every contribution — whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, better documentation, or a whole new platform implementation — helps make 3D data more accessible to everyone.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Platform | Requirements |
|:---------|:------------|
| Python | Python 3.10+, pip |
| TypeScript | Node.js 18+, npm or pnpm |
| .NET | .NET SDK 8.0+ |
| Dart | Dart SDK 3.0+ |
| C++ | CMake 3.21+, a C++17 compiler |
| All | Git, a good hex editor (recommended) |

### Understanding the Codebase

Before diving in, we recommend reading:

1. **[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — Understand the three-layer design
2. **[Binary Format Spec](docs/BINARY_FORMAT.md)** — Learn how SKP files are structured
3. **[API Design](docs/API_DESIGN.md)** — Understand the cross-platform API contract
4. **[Research Methodology](research/METHODOLOGY.md)** — How we reverse-engineered the format

---

## Development Setup

### Python

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iamahsanmehmood/openskp.git
cd openskp

# Create and activate a virtual environment
cd packages/python
python -m venv .venv

# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### TypeScript

```bash
cd packages/typescript
npm install
npm test
```

### .NET

```bash
cd packages/dotnet/OpenSkp.Tests
dotnet test
```

### Dart

```bash
cd packages/dart
dart pub get
dart test
```

### C++

```bash
cmake -S packages/cpp -B build/cpp -DOPENSKP_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build/cpp
ctest --test-dir build/cpp --output-on-failure
```

---

## Running Tests

### Python

```bash
cd packages/python

# Run the full test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=openskp --cov-report=html

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_tlv_parser.py

# Run tests matching a keyword
pytest -k "test_vertex"
```

See [Development Setup](#development-setup) above for the equivalent test
commands in TypeScript, .NET, Dart, and C++.

### Test Fixtures

Test SKP files are stored in `packages/python/tests/fixtures/`. If you need to add new test files:

1. Keep them small (< 1 MB if possible)
2. Document what each test file contains
3. Never commit files you don't have the right to distribute

3. **Run the full test suite** and ensure all tests pass
4. **Update documentation** if your change affects the API or behavior
5. **Submit a PR** using the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
6. **Wait for review** — maintainers aim to review within 48 hours

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`pytest`)
- [ ] New code has test coverage

## Coding Standards

### Python

| Rule | Standard |
|:-----|:---------|
| Formatter | `black` (line length 88) |
| Linter | `ruff` |
| Type checking | `mypy` (strict mode) |
| Docstrings | Google style |
| Imports | `isort` (profile: black) |
| Minimum version | Python 3.10 |

```python
# ✅ Good
def parse_vertex(data: bytes, offset: int = 0) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """Parse a 3D vertex from raw bytes.

    Args:
        data: Raw byte buffer containing vertex data.
        offset: Byte offset to start reading from.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (x, y, z) coordinates in inches.

    Raises:
        ParseError: If the buffer is too short for a complete vertex.
    """
    ...
```

### TypeScript

| Rule | Standard |
|:-----|:---------|
| Formatter | `prettier` |
| Linter | `eslint` |
| Type checking | `strict: true` in tsconfig |
| Module system | ESM |
| Minimum version | Node.js 18 |

### C++

| Rule | Standard |
|:-----|:---------|
| Language | C++17 |
| Formatter | `clang-format` 18 |
| Style | Google, with a 100-column limit |
| Local format | `cmake --build build/cpp --target openskp-format` |
| Local check | `cmake --build build/cpp --target openskp-format-check` |

Formatting is enforced by C++ CI. Configure with
`-DOPENSKP_CLANG_FORMAT_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/clang-format` to select a specific
local executable.

### General Principles

- **Explicit over implicit** — Name things clearly, avoid magic numbers
- **Parse, don't validate** — Convert raw bytes into typed structures as early as possible
- **Fail loudly** — Throw descriptive errors with byte offsets when parsing fails
- **Zero external dependencies** for the core parser — stdlib only
- **Cross-platform parity** — If you add a feature in one language, document the expected behavior so other platforms can follow

---

## Adding a New Platform

Want to bring OpenSKP to a new language? Fantastic! Here's the process:

### 1. Propose It First

Open an issue with the `platform` label describing:
- The target language and ecosystem
- Your experience with that language
- Estimated timeline

### 2. Follow the Architecture

All platform implementations **must** follow the [three-layer architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md):

```
Layer 1: Binary Parser     → Read raw TLV from model.dat
Layer 2: Structured Model  → Build typed model objects
Layer 3: Export Engines     → GLB, OBJ, JSON export
```

### 3. Implement the API Contract

Follow the [API Design](docs/API_DESIGN.md) specification. The public API should feel natural in the target language while maintaining behavioral equivalence.

### 4. Port the Test Suite

Every platform must pass the same behavioral tests against the same fixture files.

### 5. Directory Structure

```
<language>/
├── README.md          # Platform-specific README
├── src/               # Source code
├── tests/             # Test suite
└── <package-config>   # pyproject.toml / package.json / pubspec.yaml
```

---

## Releasing (maintainers)

Each language is released independently by pushing a tag; the corresponding
`.github/workflows/release-*.yml` picks it up and publishes to that
language's registry. Bump the version in every file that references it
*before* tagging — package manifest, README platform table, and
[docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)'s install table — then
tag exactly as below:

| Language | Version lives in | Tag to push | Registry |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | `packages/python/pyproject.toml` + `src/openskp/__init__.py` | `python-vX.Y.Z` | PyPI |
| TypeScript | `packages/typescript/package.json` (+ regenerate `package-lock.json`) | `typescript-vX.Y.Z` | npm |
| .NET | `packages/dotnet/OpenSkp/OpenSkp.csproj` (`<Version>`) | `nuget-vX.Y.Z` | NuGet |
| Dart | `packages/dart/pubspec.yaml` | **`vX.Y.Z`** (bare — not `dart-vX.Y.Z`) | pub.dev |

The Dart entry is easy to get wrong: `release-dart.yml` listens for both
`dart-v*` and bare `v*`, which looks like `dart-v0.3.0` should be the
"correct", collision-avoiding choice. It isn't — pub.dev's OIDC
trusted-publisher for this package is registered against the bare
`vX.Y.Z` pattern specifically, so `dart-v0.3.0` builds and validates the
package but fails at the upload step with *"Expected tag 'vX.Y.Z'"* (confirmed
when releasing 0.3.0). No other workflow in this repo listens for bare
`v*`, so pushing it only triggers the Dart release — verify that's still
true (`grep -A2 "tags:" .github/workflows/*.yml`) before relying on it,
in case a future workflow adds its own bare-`v*` trigger.

- OpenSKP version and platform (Python/TypeScript/Dart)
- Operating system
- SketchUp version that created the `.skp` file
- Minimal reproduction steps
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Error messages and stack traces

> [!NOTE]
> If you can share the `.skp` file that causes the issue (or a minimal reproduction), it dramatically speeds up debugging.
